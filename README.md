# Workspace Setup

In order to modify files you can either use the GitHub UI directly or checkout a local copy of the source code. For that it is recommended to use their [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Setup via Desktop App

First download the app from [their website](https://desktop.github.com/). Once installed please log-in. Make sure your account got invited to the [Studio-Nea](https://github.com/Studio-Nea?type=source) GitHub organisation and has access to this repository. You should see the repository being listed on the right side:

![GitHub App](./.github/assets/listedProject.png "GitHub App lists the target repository")

Select it and click on `Clone Studio-Nea/studio-nea.de`. A modal will ask you for the Local Path to clone the source code to. Pick a directory that works for you (ideally where you have setup MAMP or whatever PHP server you use for local development) and submit with clicking on `Clone`.

### Make Changes

You can now make changes to your local copy of the source code. After you are done you will see all changes in the GitHub app, e.g.:

![Changes GitHub App](./.github/assets/changes.png "Changes in GitHub App")

Have a check if all these changes are correct and if so commit them. You can do this by adding a comment about what you changed in the input box at the bottom right (next to your profile icon). If you like to add a broader description, use the textarea to do so but it is not mandatory. Only writing a short commit message is required.

### Push Changes Upstream

After you are done, you can push changes upstream. For that click on the button in the main window or at the top of the app, e.g.:

![Changes GitHub App](./.github/assets/pushUpstream.png "Changes in GitHub App")

That's it!

## Setup via Terminal

You can also use the command line interface and the `git` command directly. First, make sure you have `git` installed on your machine. Check out the [project docs](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for more information on that. You can verify if `git` is installed by entering:

```sh
$ git --version
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
```

Next, clone the repository via:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/your/workspace
$ git clone git@github.com:Studio-Nea/studio-nea.de.git
```

It should clone the project into `/path/to/your/workspace/studio-nea.de`. Make sure you replace the example path with a path where you actually like to download the project.

# Deployment

All changes to the `main` branch are automatically uploaded to the FTP server. No action required.
